A tentative to support CM15Pro X10 controller using Java, eventually will became a proper project.

I'm following what's reported at:
 1) http://www.linuxha.com/USB/cm15a.html
 2) http://www.eclipsehomeauto.com/cm15a_on_linux/cm15a.pdf
 3) http://home.comcast.net/~ncherry/common/cm15d/cm15d.html

Integrating (at least trying to...) everithing whit personal experiments.

Any suggestion guideline is welcome!
